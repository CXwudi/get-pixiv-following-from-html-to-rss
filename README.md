## Some notes

- The program relies on formatted HTML source where each HTML tag on its own line.
  Then the program will try to find the line that contains both user id and user name
  - Check examples in [`html`](./html) folder
- You don't have to save the whole web page, partial HTML source works as well,
as long as it contains all artists in the source file
- There are many many online HTML formatting site available for you
- Since this is a spring-boot project, 
  you can customize the program behavior using spring-configuration's recommended 
  [way](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/spring-boot-features.html#boot-features-external-config-files)
  - Here is all hackable configuration -> [`application.yml`](./src/main/resources/application.yml)
- I personally tested on TTRSS, it actually works ðŸ˜‚
